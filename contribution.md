## Contribution Guide for This Repository

> please see hacktoberfest assignments here https://github.com/rizkytegar/veonote/issues.

Thank you for participating in our project! Here are the steps to contribute properly:

1. **Star This Repository** ⭐
   - If you like this project or find it helpful, don’t forget to star the repository.

2. **Check the Features We Need** 🔍
   - Before contributing, take a look at the features or improvements we need. Check the list of **issues** we’ve already created.

3. **Create an Issue if You Have Ideas or Feedback** 💡
   - If you have a new idea, suggestion, or find a problem, feel free to create a **new issue** in this repository. We highly value feedback from the community.

4. **Hacktoberfest Guide** 📚
   - If you’re participating in Hacktoberfest, please read the official guide here: [Hacktoberfest Participation Guide](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/).

5. **Write Good Commit Messages** 📝
   - Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive. Avoid vague commit messages like “update” or “fix bug.” Examples of good commit messages:
     - `"Add search feature to the homepage"`
     - `"Fix mobile responsiveness issue on the edit note page"`
     - `"Improve form validation on the add note page"`

6. **Duplicate Pull Requests** 🔁
   - If multiple pull requests (PRs) address the same issue or feature, we will choose the best one. The decision will not necessarily be based on who submitted first, but rather on the quality of the contribution.

7. **No Comments in the Code** 🚫
   - Do not add any comments in the code. Keep the code clean for now without comments. I have my own reasons for this specific case.

8. **Proposing New Features** 💻
   - If you want to add a new feature that is not currently listed in the Hacktoberfest tasks, please create an issue first and tag me, @rizkytegar.

Thank you for your contribution!
